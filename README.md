## 🧠 Ruby Basics — Foundational Exploration & Practice

### 📌 Overview  
This repo is a **personal sandbox** for exploring end-to-end **Ruby fundamentals**, including syntax, object-oriented programming, and utility scripting. It’s structured as a learning log to deepen understanding and build muscle memory through hands-on experimentation.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Ruby  
- **Environment**: CLI, IRB, VS Code, Ubuntu  
- **Focus Areas**: OOP, file handling, authentication logic, string manipulation

### 🚀 Highlights  
- `authenticator.rb`: Simulates login logic and credential checks  
- `analyzer.rb`: Processes input data for basic analysis  
- `playground.rb`: Freeform experimentation with Ruby syntax  
- `OOP_projects/`: Exercises focused on class structures and inheritance

### 📁 Structure  
- Modular scripts organized by concept  
- No external dependencies—pure Ruby logic  
- Ideal for IRB testing and CLI execution

### 🧠 Reflection  
This repo helped me internalize **Ruby’s design philosophy**, from elegant syntax to flexible object modeling. It became a space where I broke things, fixed them, and learned through every iteration. It’s less about polished results—and more about learning through rhythm, repetition, and raw logic.
