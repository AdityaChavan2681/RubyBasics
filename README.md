🧠 Ruby Basics — Foundational Exploration & Practice

📌 Overview
This repo is a personal sandbox for exploring end-to-end Ruby fundamentals, including syntax, object-oriented programming, and utility scripts. It’s designed as a learning log to deepen understanding and build muscle memory through hands-on experimentation.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Ruby

Environment: CLI / IRB / VS Code / Ubuntu

Focus Areas: OOP, file handling, authentication logic, string manipulation

🚀 Highlights
authenticator.rb: Simulates login logic and credential checks

analyzer.rb: Processes input data for basic analysis

playground.rb: Freeform experimentation with Ruby syntax

OOP projects/: Contains exercises focused on class structures and inheritance

📁 Structure
Modular scripts organized by concept

No external dependencies—pure Ruby logic

Ideal for IRB testing or CLI execution

🧠 Reflection
This repo helped me internalize Ruby’s design philosophy, from elegant syntax to flexible object modeling. It’s a space where I’ve broken things, fixed them, and learned through every iteration.
